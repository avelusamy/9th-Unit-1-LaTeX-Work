\section{Bio: Aditya Velusamy}
I am Aditya Velusamy. I am in 9th grade and a linux enjoyer(currently a Linux Mint user but I have used Manjaro and Debian). I enjoy tinkering with computers and technology. I hope that in this class I can get more proficient with LaTeX as well as explore more areas of maths.
\section{Bio: Kayla Dayman}
I am Kayla Dayman, I'm currently a freshman and I am not an interesting person. My main hobby is crochet, which I've been doing for about five and a half years. I also got a 5 on the AP Calculus BC test. I hope to become a bigger nerd than I already am over the course of the year.
